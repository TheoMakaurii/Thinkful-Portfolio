                Like many people during the year 2020, I chose to social distance in an attempt to flatten the curve of
                the
                rampant spread of COVID-19.

                While social distancing, I developed a new interest in learning programming languages.

                Please feel free to click the images on this page in order to test out some of my first JavaScript apps.

            <h3>Mad Lib</h3>
            <p>The more I learned about the way JavaScript and HTML worked together, the more eager I was to explore this relationship. I set out to build this madlib app without the help of a tutorial, but leaned heavily on W3 Schools and Mozilla documentation to help me render input variables as new HTML. This app was built using Vanilla JS and depends heavily on span tags  and input text values to interpolate funny words into the narrative.</p>

            <h3>Tic Tac Toe</h3>
            <p>Who doesn't enjoy Tic Tac Toe! I did need to draw inspiration from a fellow Github user to make this app, but I am excited to expand my version as I learn more advanced JavaScript. This game depends the event listener "onClick" to render basic "X" and "O" letters into the cells.  My eventual goal is to use conditional statements in order to create a computer player for the game. </p>
