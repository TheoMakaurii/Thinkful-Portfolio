                Like many people during the year 2020, I chose to social distance in an attempt to flatten the curve of
                the
                rampant spread of COVID-19.

                While social distancing, I developed a new interest in learning programming languages.

                    <h3>TooDo</h3>
                    <p>This is a standard to-do list app. I was just getting my feet wet with JavaScript using a CodePen tutorial as inspiration. The app is written in Vanilla JS. Its depends on input text values and event listeners the render new items and delete them from the list. For me, the best way to get the day started is to warm up with a to-do list. Making this app was a fun way to survey a new territory while also making a useful tool for myself.</p>

                <h3>Tip Calculator</h3>
                <p>During college I worked as a bartender. It seems only fitting that I should use my new skills to manifest a very simple but variable calculation. This app was written in Vanilla JS and depends heavily on conditional statements and dropdowns to complete the calculations.</p>

            </a>
            <h3>Conversion Calculator</h3>
            <p>This conversion calculator was the first JavaScript app I made without the direct help of a tutorial. After learning about conditional statements and how they work, I felt confident that building simple conversion-calculator was something I could surely accomplish.This app was written in Vanilla JS and depends heavily on conditional statements and dropdowns to complete the calculations.</p>

            <h3>Mad Lib</h3>
            <p>The more I learned about the way JavaScript and HTML worked together, the more eager I was to explore this relationship. I set out to build this madlib app without the help of a tutorial, but leaned heavily on W3 Schools and Mozilla documentation to help me render input variables as new HTML. This app was built using Vanilla JS and depends heavily on span tags  and input text values to interpolate funny words into the narrative.</p>

            <h3>Tic Tac Toe</h3>
            <p>Who doesn't enjoy Tic Tac Toe! I did need to draw inspiration from a fellow Github user to make this app, but I am excited to expand my version as I learn more advanced JavaScript. This game depends the event listener "onClick" to render basic "X" and "O" letters into the cells.  My eventual goal is to use conditional statements in order to create a computer player for the game. </p>
