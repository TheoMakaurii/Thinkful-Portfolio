                <p>I was formerly a product brochure copywriter for a company called InventHelp.
                    When the rampant spread of COVID-19 forced many Americans to social distance,
                    I knew it was an ideal time to foster new skills. </p>
                <p>Everyone knows Shakespeare wrote King Lear while forced to quarantine during the bubonic plague. What
                    could I do? </p>
                <p> I began reading about the fundamentals of
                    programming and even tried my hand at a few basic javascript apps. I made fun and simple games,
                    madlibs and tic-tac-toe. I want to do more, and I want to work with great programmers. </p>

                 <p> My knowledge base is growing quickly. Let me work with you and your team to create an ideal user  experience. I am skilled in the essential mark up languages HTML and CSS. I have substantial practice using JS libraries and frameworks such as jQuery and React. Because my program is remote I am incredibly comfortable navigating the command line to deploy apps and sites using Git. </p>

                <p> As my skills develop I want to make the web more accessible for all
                    individuals. The worldwide web opened doors for so many people. I want to open doors for so many
                    more.</p>
